# any peer implies that any multiplayer auth can run this func (call and remote recieve)
@rpc("call_local")
func test_func():
	print("called by: " + str(multiplayer.get_remote_sender_id()) +" "+ str(multiplayer.is_server()) +" "+ "character:" + str(character.name) + ": test_func")

Example:
called by: 1 false character:1: test_func
called by: 1 false character:1824665408: test_func
called by: 1 true character:1: test_func
called by: 1 true character:1824665408: test_func

The second line will not run as the multiplayer auth is not the server (1)
This applies to remote only, as the last line runs even though multiplayer
auth is not 1. 

FIX: make sure the object ur calling on has auth = 1 on remote devices. 
* if you want to ensure that clients dont cant start the rpc call. 
* if ur feeling lazy, just add "any_peer" it becomes less of a server-client.
